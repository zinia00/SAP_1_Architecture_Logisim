## Architecture and Functional Block Analysis

### System Architecture Overview
The processor architecture uses a **unified single-bus design** with an **8-bit datapath** controlled by tri-state sources. Bus arbitration ensures that only **one driver** is active during each T-state, with possible drivers including `pc_out`, `sram_rd`, `ins_reg_out_en`, `a_out`, `b_out`, `alu_out`, and `sh_out`. Bus listener components such as `mar_in_en`, `ins_reg_in_en`, `a_in`, `b_in`, and `sram_wr` allow selective data capture when required.

![Manual/Loader Mode Control Sequencer](images/manual_ckt.png)
**Figure 2:** Manual/Loader mode operation of the control sequencer showing secure program loading with debug and handshake signals.  

### Register Implementation (A, B)

The **A and B registers** use `reg_gp` modules to store **8-bit data**. They have three interfaces:

1. **Input:** Connected to the system bus; controlled by `a_in` and `b_in` signals.  
2. **Output:** Drives the bus via tri-state logic using `a_out` and `b_out`.  
3. **Internal:** Provides direct access to the **ALU** through `reg_int_out` without using the bus.

![A/B Register Subsystem](images/2_ins_reg_.png)
**Figure 3:** A/B register subsystem with input, output, and internal interfaces.  

### Program Counter (PC) Implementation

The **Program Counter (PC)** supports **dual modes** for sequential execution and program flow control:

- **Increment Mode:** At timing state `T3`, when `pc_en = 1`, the PC updates as `PC ← PC + 1`, enabling sequential instruction progression.  
- **Jump Mode:** During a `JMP` instruction at timing state `T4`, when `jump_en = 1`, the lower nibble of the Instruction Register (IR) is placed on the bus and loaded into the PC for direct program control transfer.  

**Bus Interface:** At timing state `T1`, when `pc_out = 1`, the current PC value is driven onto the system bus and loaded into the **Memory Address Register (MAR)** to start the instruction fetch cycle.

**Figure 4:** Program Counter showing **increment and jump modes**. 

![Program Counter Direct Load](images/pc_b.png)
**Figure 5:** Program Counter direct load and sequential functionality. 

### Memory System and Address Register

The memory subsystem includes a **4-bit Memory Address Register (MAR)** which captures addresses from the system bus under the control of `mar_in_en`.

- **Instruction Fetching:** During the `T1` phase, `pc_out` and `mar_in_en` load the Program Counter value into the MAR for instruction fetch.  
- **Operand Addressing:** During `T4` of `LDA`, `LDB`, `STA`, or `JMP` instructions, `ins_reg_out_en` together with `mar_in_en` transfers the operand address (`IR[3:0]`) into the MAR.

The **SRAM** operates in two modes:  
- **Read Mode:** When `sram_rd = 1`, the value at `RAM[MAR]` is placed on the bus during `T2` (instruction fetch) and `T5` (LDA/LDB).  
- **Write Mode:** When `sram_wr = 1`, the data on the bus is written into `RAM[MAR]` during `T5` of the `STA` instruction.

![Memory Element](images/fig_5.png)

**Figure 6:** Register-based memory element showing `data_in`, `wr_en`, `rd_en`, clock, and chip select (`cs`) signals. Output to the bus is via `data_out`.  

![Memory Subsystem](images/fig_6.png)

**Figure 7:** Memory subsystem showing MAR operation and SRAM read/write timing.  


### Instruction Register and Opcode Decoder

The **Instruction Register (IR)** has a dual role for **instruction storage** and **operand handling**:

1. **Instruction Loading:** During `T2`, signals `sram_rd = 1` and `ins_reg_in_en = 1` transfer `IR ← M[MAR]`, capturing the instruction from memory.  
2. **Opcode Handling:** The upper nibble `IR[7:4]` goes to the **opcode decoder** (`ins_tab`), generating one-hot control signals for the decoded instruction.  
3. **Operand Handling:** The lower nibble `IR[3:0]` can be placed onto the system bus when `ins_reg_out_en = 1` (typically during `T4`) to provide operand addresses or target values for memory and jump instructions.

The **opcode decoder (`ins_tab`)** implements a **4-to-16 decoding scheme**, producing one-hot signals such as `insLDA`, `insLDB`, `insADD`, `insSUB`, `insSTA`, `insJMP`, `insHLT`, with unused outputs reserved for future instructions.

![Instruction Register and Opcode Decoder](images/fig_7.png)
**Figure 8:** Architecture of the Instruction Register and opcode decoder, showing instruction loading, opcode routing, and operand forwarding.

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Implementation

The **ALU subsystem** performs **8-bit arithmetic** with the following features:

- **Input Sources:** Operands come directly from `A.reg_int_out` and `B.reg_int_out`, bypassing the bus.  
- **Operation Control:** `alu_sub = 1` selects subtraction (`A − B`); otherwise, addition (`A + B`) is performed.  
- **Execution Protocol:** During `T4`, with `a_out = 1`, `b_out = 1`, `alu_out = 1`, and `a_in = 1`, the ALU executes `A ← A ± B` in one step.  
- **Architectural Design:** Ripple-carry adder with mode control; simple hardware with linear carry propagation delay.  
- **Bus Interface:** ALU output drives the system bus only when `alu_out = 1` via tri-state logic.

![ALU Implementation](images/fig_8.png)
**Figure 9:** ALU implementation with ripple-carry architecture and tri-state bus interface. 


### Boot/Loader Counter and Phase Generation

The **boot/loader subsystem (`ins_loader`)** securely transfers program data from ROM to RAM in **Manual/Loader mode**:

1. **Functional Role:** Loads programs from ROM to RAM when `debug = 1`, disabling normal fetch-execute logic.  
2. **Input Interface:** Accepts `clk`, `bc_reset` (counter reset), `bc_en` (count enable), and `debug` for mode selection.  
3. **Address Sequencing:** Uses a 4-bit `CTR4` counter for upward counting, producing addresses `bc_address[3:0]` for systematic RAM writes.  
4. **Phase Control:** Generates two non-overlapping clock phases (`Φ` and `¬Φ`) via a D flip-flop with feedback inversion to synchronize data transfer and prevent contention.

![Boot/Loader Subsystem](images/fig_9.png)
**Figure 10:** Boot/loader subsystem with sequential address generation and dual-phase clocking.  


## Control System Design

The **control unit** translates instructions into precisely timed control pulses to:  
1. Ensure exclusive bus driver activation.  
2. Enable appropriate latch operations during each T-state.  

Key components include:  
- **Ring Counter (RC):** Generates timing states T1–T6.  
- **Opcode Decoder:** Produces activation lines for instruction-specific micro-operations.  
- **Mode Control Inputs:** `debug` (manual/loader selection), `i1/i2` (loader handshake) defining CPU mode (~debug with loader masking via ~i2).  

The control sequencer operates in two paradigms:  
- **Automatic Execution Mode:** Optimized for fetch–decode–execute cycles.  
- **Manual/Loader Mode:** Optimized for safe program loading and debugging.  

Both modes maintain **strict signal integrity** and **timing synchronization**.

![Manual Mode Control Sequencer](images/fig_10_manual.png)
**Figure 11:** SAP-1 Manual Mode control sequencer  

The **Manual Mode** sequencer provides a simplified execution pathway, supporting only the ADD instruction for *step-wise verification* and *manual debugging*.  
 
![Automatic Mode Control Sequencer](images/fig_11_auto.png)
**Figure 12:** SAP-1 Automatic Mode control sequencer 

The **Automatic Mode** sequencer manages the full fetch–decode–execute cycle for ADD, SUB, and JMP instructions using **ring counter timing** combined with **opcode decoding**, ensuring **efficient bus utilization** and **precise timing**.

## Timing Control Generator

A **ring counter** generates six phases (T1–T6) to orchestrate the fetch–decode–execute cycle, ensuring deterministic micro-operation sequencing.

### Universal Fetch Sequence

For every instruction:  
- **T1:** PC output enabled and captured by MAR (MAR ← PC).  
- **T2:** Memory read initiated (`sram_rd`) and IR loaded (IR ← M[MAR]).  
- **T3:** PC incremented (PC ← PC + 1).

![Timing Control Generator](images/fig_12_rc.png)
**Figure 13:** Six-phase ring counter  

### Representative Execute Sequences

- **LDA addr:**  
  - T4: Operand address (IR[3:0]) placed on bus and loaded into MAR.  
  - T5: Memory value read and latched into A (A ← M[MAR]).  
- **ADD:**  
  - T4: A and B outputs drive ALU; result fed back to A (`alu_sub = 0`).  
- **SUB:**  
  - T4: Similar to ADD with subtraction (`alu_sub = 1`).  
- **JMP addr:**  
  - T4: Operand placed on bus and loaded into PC (PC ← IR[3:0]).

## Automatic Operation Control Logic

Automatic operation uses:  
- **C = CPU ~debug**  
- **L = ~i2 (loader idle)**  

These signals coordinate the fetch–decode–execute cycle for deterministic micro-operation execution.

| b_out   | T4 & C & (insADD \| insSUB)                          |

## Manual/Loader Operation Control

In **Manual/Loader Mode**, `debug = 1` masks normal CPU fetch–decode–execute operations.  

Program transfer follows a **handshake protocol**:  
- **i1:** Enables address placement into MAR.  
- **i2:** Activates SRAM write operations.  

This ensures **safe memory loading** without bus contention.

## Instruction Set Architecture

### Instruction Encoding Scheme
The instruction encoding system utilizes *upper nibble = IR[7:4]* for opcode specification and *lower nibble* for 4-bit operand/address when required.

### Assembler

The assembler translates *SAP-1 assembly language programs* into *machine code (hexadecimal)* suitable for execution in Logisim.  
It supports instructions such as *LDA, LDB, ADD, SUB, STA, JMP, and HLT*, along with directives like **ORG** and **DEC**.  
The tool automatically generates *Logisim-compatible v2.0 raw hex output*, avoiding manual conversion errors.  

This enables efficient program development, testing, and debugging of the SAP-1 system.

## Operation

The CPU functions through a repetitive sequence of operations controlled by the system clock, known as the *fetch–decode–execute* cycle.  

### Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle

**Fetch**  
T1: Program Counter (PC) outputs the current instruction address onto the bus, stored in MAR.  
T2: Memory places the instruction on the bus, captured by IR.  
T3: PC increments to point to the next instruction.  

**Decode**  
Opcode in IR is sent to the instruction decoder, which activates the corresponding control line.  
Combined with the active timing state, this defines required control signals.  

**Execute**  
Control unit asserts relevant signals to carry out micro-operations.  
Execution time varies by instruction (e.g., LDA requires 2 states, ADD requires 2, HLT requires 1).  
The process repeats until HLT stops execution.
